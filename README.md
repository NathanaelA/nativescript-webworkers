## Notes

Please note The WebWorker environment is a LIMITED JavaScript shell.  It does have AJAX/HTTP(s) ability; but it does NOT have any access to any of the NativeScript api.  It also does not have any access to the Native iOS or Android api's.  It is strictly a JS thread.  In addition at this moment "ImportScripts" has not been implemented.  It should be fairly easy to implement; and if anyone wants to do a pull request to implement this; I'd be happy to add it to the code that gets injected into the environment.

If the device has more than one CPU; the Worker threads should not impact the main NativeScript thread.  However, if the device only has one CPU; and depending on how busy you make the worker, it will impact the primary NativeScript thread.

## Installation

Run `tns plugin add nativescript-webworkers` in your ROOT directory of your project.

## Usage

To use the  module you must first `require()` it:

```js
var WebWorker = require( 'nativescript-webworkers' );

var myWorker = new Worker('~/web.worker.js'); // i.e. the Standard Browser way
// -- or --
var myWorker = new WebWorker('~/web.worker.js'); // i.e. using the WebWorker variable returned by the require statement.
```

## NativeScript environment
### Events
####.onmessage(data)
This will have the JSON object that was sent from the worker

####.onerror
This will have any errors that occured (this may be unreliable; as not all errors can be tracked properly)

####.onready
This is fired when the webworker environment is ready to go.  
**This is NOT a standard webworker function**

### Methods
####.postMessage(data)
This posts the message into the webworker environment
####.terminate()
This terminates the webworker environment; after this is ran; DO NOT attempt to continue doing anything on this webworker.


## WebWorker Environment
### Events

####onmessage(data)
The function that gets any messages from the NativeScript environment

####onready()
This function will get called if it exists once the webworker is able to communicate with the NativeScript host.
**This is NOT a standard webworker function**

### Methods
####postMessage(data)
The function you use to send message back to the NativeScript environment

####close()
Terminates this environment


##Example:
### NativeScript code:
```js
  require( 'nativescript-webworkers' );
  var myWorker = new Worker('~/test.worker.js');
  myWorker.onmessage = function(m) { console.log("Webworker said:", m); };
  myWorker.postMessage("Hello");
```

### test.worker.js
```js
  onmessage = function(m) {
    console.log("NativeScript said" + m);	
  };
  onready = function() {
    postMessage("Hi");
  };
```
